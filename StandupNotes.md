# Standup Notes

### Notes for Lab 3

### Leeor Nehardea
  
  - I spent most of the time trying to understand how to work with CSS & HTML. Since I lack experience, some parts took me a while to figure.
  - Today, I have left to finish the last touches and submit the lab.
  - As this is a short solo lab, I wasn't waiting on anyone to finish other parts.
  - I did the best for this lab, I hope it's okay. Also, as I don't have feedback from the HTML part, I can assume that what I did is fine, so I only built on top of it and didn't modify it. Everything should be ready to submit before the deadline.
